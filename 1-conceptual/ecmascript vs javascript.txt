ECMAScript is the language, 
whereas JavaScript, JScript, and even ActionScript 3 are called "dialects".

JavaScript was originally named Mocha and changed to Livescript but ultimately became JavaScript.




ECMAScript = ES:
==================

ECMAScript is a Standard for scripting languages.

Languages like Javascript are based on the ECMAScript standard.

ECMA Standard is based on several originating technologies, the most well known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft).

ECMA means European Computer Manufacturer’s Association

JavaScript = JS:
=================
JavaScript is the most popular implementation of the ECMAScript Standard.

The core features of Javascript are based on the ECMAScript standard,  but Javascript also has other additional features that are not in the ECMA specifications/standard.

ActionScript and JScript are other languages that implement the ECMAScript.

JavaScript was submitted to ECMA for standardization but due to trademark issues with the name Javascript the standard became called ECMAScript.

Every browser has a JavaScript interpreter.

ES5 = ECMAScript 5:
===================

ES5 is a version of the ECMAScript (old/current one).

ES5 is the JavaScript you know and use in the browser today.

ES5 does not require a build step (transpilers) to transform it into something that will run in today's browsers.

ECMAScript version 5 was finished in December 2009,  the latest versions of all major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and IE)  have implemented version 5.

Version 5.1 was finished in June, 2011.

ES6 = ECMAScript 6 = ES2015 = ECMAScript 2015:
=================================================

ES2015 is a version of the ECMAScript (new/future one).

Officially the name ES2015 should be used instead of ES6.

ES6 will tackle many of the core language shortcomings addressed in  TypeScript and CoffeeScript.

ES6 is the next iteration of JavaScript, but it does not run in today's browsers.

There are quite a few transpilers that will export ES5 for running in browsers.

BabelJS:
========

BabelJS is the most popular transpiler that transforms new JavaScript ES6 to Old JavaScript ES5.

BabelJS makes it possible for writing the next generation of JavaScript today (means ES2015).

BabelJS simply takes ES2015 file and transform it into ES5 file.

Current browsers versions can now understand the new JavaScript code (ES2015), even if they don't yet support it.

TypeScript and CoffeeScript:

Both provides syntactic sugar on top of ES5  and then are transcompiled into ES5 compliant JavaScript. 

You write TypeScript or CoffeeScript then the transpiler transforms it into ES5 JavaScript.
