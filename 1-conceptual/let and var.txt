let allows javascript engine to use block scoping. block level scoping.
>> let is declared inside the block.

if(a > b) {

 let c = true;

}

>> let is only available inside that block at that period of time running the code.
if you have a for loop with let inside - 
it allows us to have a different value in memory of that variable each time the loop repeats.


let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. This is unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.
